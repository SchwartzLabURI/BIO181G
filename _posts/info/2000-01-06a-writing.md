* Be concrete rather than abstract (see below)
* Use active verbs (exciting and not passive voice)
  * Eliminate forms of "to be" as much as possible (e.g. "be" "is", "was", "were", "are")
* Put human beings in rather than writing impersonally
* Use shorter sentences
* Use simpler and more compact words 
* Omit needless words 
* Include a conclusion

"What is a concrete noun?" you ask.

"It's something you can drop on your foot. It's that simple."

"So if I am writing about markets, productivity and wealth, I am going to...."

"Yes indeed -- you are going to write about things you can drop on your foot, and people, too. Green peppers, ears of corn, windshield wipers, or a grimy mechanic changing your car's oil. No matter how abstract your topic, how intangible, your first step is to find things you can drop on your foot."
