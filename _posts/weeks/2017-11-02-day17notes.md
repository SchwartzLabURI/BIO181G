### Biodiversity data

#### What information is available on biodiversity?

* ocean depth, temp, water chemistry, solar radiation
* terrestrial temps, first freeze, etc.
* location data and changes over time for lots of species
  * lots of people recording observations

#### How were these data collected?

* Inconsistancies in what's recorded
  * eg. sometimes seeing dog or cat
  * how often do we record human
  * how easy is it to see something hard to see
  * how easy is it to overlook the obvious
* Some data is collected by non-scientists, some by scientists
* Data is often volunteered - where ever these people are
  * ebird, inaturalist
  * not totally reliable
* Data may be collected systematically
  * Aquamaps - research studies - locations of species
  * Aquamaps - ocean depth, temperature, physical characteristics
  
  
#### Are there any ethical concerns about the collection or use of these data?
* 1st world consumerism and impacts on 3rd world countries with high biodiversity


#### If thereâ€™s a model how is it constructed?

* Think about what's recorded - how data is collected
* Aquamaps - predictive model of where a species might be
  * make correlations in known areas for known data
  * use correlations to predict response variable (# or probability or diversity) in unknown areas
* model change over time of particular species
  * find predictive variables
