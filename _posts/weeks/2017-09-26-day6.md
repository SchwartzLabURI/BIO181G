### Before class:

Watch: 

[Why smart statistics are the key to fighting crime](https://www.ted.com/talks/anne_milgram_why_smart_statistics_are_the_key_to_fighting_crime)

[Justice course: Individual rights](http://justiceharvard.org/lecture-7-this-land-is-your-land/)
This is a bit off topic, but think about why we have a justice system in the first place that is using all these analytics to make choices about people, and why we allow that. If someone is stopped by the police what rights do they have? (see O'Neill reading for a complementary discussion of why people might be concerned about what rights they have)

Read:

[Risks of data in criminal justice](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/01/eric-holder-moneyball-criminal-justice_n_5641420.html)

[Risk assessment when deciding bail](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/27/us/turning-the-granting-of-bail-into-a-science.html)

O'Neill chapter 5 (Civilian Casualties). You might need to read the early chapters to understand some of the references in this chapter.
