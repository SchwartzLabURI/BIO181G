### Ethical issues in genomics

#### Genetic testing

* Maybe you don't want to know, especially if it's untreatable
  * emotional consequences
* Who pays?
* Not 100%
  * Accuracy
  * Genetic variants indicate risk

#### Identification

* Crime scenes - accuracy? contamination?
  * each person has unique variants
  * how are we doing this identification?
    * comparing to a population
  * errors
  * taking someone's DNA because they've been arrested

#### Personal genomic medicine

* Assuming everyone's genome is on file can they be discriminated against?
  * how about your insurance?
* Who pays for genomic testing for personal medicine or the medicine itself?
* Rare variants may need special medication to be effective but it's not worth developing this
  * Majority - variants
  * Majority - race / ethnicity

#### Intellectual property

* Can you patent genome data?
* If you have a method to alter genomes (positively) it might be expensive for treatments
* But we want to encourage pharm to invest in genome tech
