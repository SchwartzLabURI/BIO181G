### The Political Polls Got It Wrong
* This is the appearance
* Polls are imperfect estimates at a single point in time
  * Polls have known average error and error varies over the years
  * They are pretty good, but sometimes error is high
  * We forget this
* The error in the estimate of Clinton's percentage was actually very low (1%)
  * Difference between percent vote for all polls is in the margin of error
* Obama outperformed polls 
  * Created an assumption that Democrats should outperform polls
  * the polls were actually worse (off by 3%)
* Idea is that lots of polls reduce uncertainty (ie don't pay attention to individual uncertainty)
* Clinton had a 67% probability according to 538
  * that means that there is a real possibility that Trump could win
* Significant differences between models
  * Why? see error in model assumptions below
  * aggregators are taking polls and creating models without considering assumptions properly
* Thought that 8 50/50 states all had to go to Trump
  * this is a bad assumption!
  * if these states are independent the probability is .5^8 = <1%
  * BUT error is correlated - tendency for Trump to overperform
    * thus if Wisconsin is underestimated (and goes for Trump) so will PA and FL etc
* For blue states Clinton over and underperformed equally 
* correlation between poll error and % white non-college vote
  * states we talk about as battleground (eg WI, PA, FL, OH) have lots of white non-college
  * this population is increasingly leaning Republican
  * GOP has lost white college grads
  * BUT if this group was sampled correctly it wouldn't create biased polls
  * this population also isn't turning out to vote
    * assuming this means that if you're wrong you introduce error in the poll 
    * using a formula to decide if you will vote and whether you should be counted in poll
    * more likely to drop less educated voters from poll
    * small errors lead to just enough underestimation to create consistant bias
* Take poll and weight on the basis of the census
  * weights do not include education, but if education matters than there's bias
    * the influence of education has changed 
* Error in aggregator models
  * greater uncertainty in 2016 due to non-incumbant
  * lots of late deciders influenced by negative Clinton press
* Were people afraid to admit to voting for Trump
  * BUT social pressure would be mostly in blue states, but those states were consistent w polls
  * BUT Republicans consistently outperformed polls
* We will hopefully adjust for error in models but there may be other issues in future
  * reweight data to account for education
  * reconsider likely voter formula
* Polls have been having issues elsewhere 
  * eg Brexit passed
  * eg Colombia voted against FARC peace deal
* Confirmation bias
  * media believed it couldn't happen so they take the pieces that look like this and believe them
  * early voting suggested Clinton
* If polls were wrong about elections what does that say about approval ratings?
  * BUT approval rating is all people; no worries about likely voter and associated formula
  * BUT popular vote estimate was very good
* Other cases of correlated error
  * probability of massive subprime loan defaults in 2007
    * spreading out risk of any given default sounds great
    * HOWEVER if one fails then likely everything else will fail
    * SO we think risk is reduced but instead risk is high throughout

### Factors that were underestimated
* Clinton had lost before
* Trump had been winning more than expected
* People looking for something different
* Setbacks immediately prior to voting
* Comey investigation right before election
