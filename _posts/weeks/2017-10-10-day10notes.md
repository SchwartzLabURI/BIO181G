### Similarities among models

* Crime model generates a prediction about where to police just as flu model generates a prediction of where to staff hospitals
* Political polls weren't quite accurate just like flu prediction
  * doesn't consider changes in keywords that people are using - model based on different data than being generated
  * don't consider particular effects of this election that's unique
* potentially relating two factors that are related one year but not the next
  * need some human awareness of how predictions are being made
  * need more testing
* data is very noisy
  * don't overfit your data
* sales model is predictive - data makes sense with response
  * google - data = everything, may or may not make sense
* when we use the census we have to account for how we measure race
  * google doesn't account for changes in human behavior
