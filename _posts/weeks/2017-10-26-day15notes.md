### Genomes

* Potential for gene editing
* Everyone has the same genes, but most people have different alleles (variants)
* Benefits of finding your genome variants - disease related
* Protein structure can determine types of variants
* Carrying an allele can mean high risk but not guarantee a disease
* Genetics inform about ancestry
* There are lots of mutations, not all have an effect (eg cancer)
* Similar species have similar genomes
* Visualization is cool - circos plots - see variants, pathways, structural rearrangements
* How many variants cause a disease
* Different locations associated with a single disease / pathway / phenotype
* We now know links between genotype and phenotype (in human)
* We're mostly the same genetically 
* Lots of pathways - lots of genes for each - spread out
* Pleiotropy - one gene affects different phenotype
* We know certain alleles in genes and what they code for - phenotype
* Genotypes connected to career 
* Microbiomes! There are whole communities of bacteria everywhere and we can now identify millions of them with genome sequencing
