### What we do with genomes

#### Genetic engineering

* Any genetically modified organism not just food
* We are modifying human embryos (not allowing to go to term)
  * Correct disease
* Inserting DNA from other organism to...
  * acheive desired traits
  * avoid impact of disease / pest 
* Roundup ready

#### Microbiomes

* Human microbiome impacts our immune system, affects autoimmune disease, obesity, autism
* We have tried to avoid / eliminate microorganisms
  * But they aren't necessarily pathogenic

#### Personalized genomic medicine

* Certain treatments work better depend on their genetics
* Predict disease risk (if we know which alleles you have)
* Potentially reduce mortality
* Arthritis, asthma, etc. medicines often don't work
  * if we understand genetic makeup, maybe able to know which medicine works for whom
* A single disease can have different types with different treatments
  * Need to know genetic type to tailor treatment

#### Individual identification / ancestry

* Individual data (variants) to determine ancestry
* DNA can suggest your similarity to different populations

#### Evolution

* Observe trends in changes in allele frequency
* Genome structure can change
* See trends in how organisms change
