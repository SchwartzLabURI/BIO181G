  * stats that optimize probability of success in a situation

#### Basketball
* what is correlated with contribution of a player?
  * success rate?
  * overall total points?
  * how many risky shots should a player take?
* shot quantity negatively correlated with available time
* success based on shot distance / shot location

#### Football
* heart rate / health data correlated endurance
  * optimize training 
  * time to push harder, time to scale back
* statistics for particular positions
  * correlate particular stats with benefit to team
  * particular stats related to precise situational benefit
  
#### Tennis
* stats correlated with winning
* probability of winning based on particular situation
* less complicated than team sports?

#### Soccer
* correlation between location and wins
* wins correlated with fan turnout

#### Hockey
