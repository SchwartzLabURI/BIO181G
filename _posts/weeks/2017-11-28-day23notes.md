### NYC traffic

* Goal: reduce accidents
* Intervention: eg new street signs
  * To what extent will these work and how much do you spend?
* Could be more effective 
  * e.g. Broadway has a lot of accidents (tho not fatalities)
  * other locations have fewer accidents, more fatalities
  * where should cops be???
* what are the characteristics of intersections where accidents happen?
* Goal: having Uber reduces car uses
  * Observation: Uber = more cars and less transit
* Data availability
  * avaiable but still difficult to get and analyze

### BC Transit

* Target areas where people come and go - high traffic
  * count people! indicates greater and lesser use
  * cards / phone app 
* Modeling high traffic areas
  * Can we predict areas that need a lot of transit?
  * Take high transit locations and lot of info
  * Build model - what's predictive
  * Make sure the model works
* Twitter data 
  * Improve locations tagged as not performing well
  * Keep in mind that not everyone tweets
    * younger
    * likely more well off
*
