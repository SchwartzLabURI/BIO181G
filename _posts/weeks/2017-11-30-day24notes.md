### Data

* average income of uber users
  * where does this come from? perhaps location of pickup = census income
* commute time
  * where does this come from?
* jobs in particular areas - census
* income / housing of individuals - census
* location of uber users - geolocation in phone and app usage
* number residents in a city - census
* number of transit riders - bus records and nyc databases?
* number of taxi riders - taxi records and nyc databases?
* value of businesses - stock exchange and ??
* income data for particular areas - census
* transit data for locations - bus stops, distance to nearest stop, how often pickups occur etc
* uber has general data on where people need pickups

### Analyses, models, correlations

* correlate uber use and taxi use (as one goes up the other goes up)
* correlate taxi/uber use with transit use (negative correlation)
* correlate income with taxi/uber use
* correlation between income and commute time (negative)
* correlation between commute time and social mobility
* correlation between time of day and time between trains
* correlate taxi/uber use and transit availability

### Ethics

* commute time - social mobility; commute time - transit is located; transit is located - twitter complaints, frequency of use
* should uber (or the gov't or google) know where you are and where you're going
  * it's part of their business
