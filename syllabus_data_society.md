**Course Description:** 

Big data affects virtually every area of our society, from the advertising we see, to how we think about politics, to genome-based medicine. Our ability to collect immense amounts of information has the potential to improve many aspects of our lives, but it can also be misleading and biased. We will consider how data are analyzed and how results from those analyses are used to make policy in an increasingly data-driven world. You will also develop reasoning skills so that you can think critically about the data that is held up in today's society as providing answers to many questions. This course meets the General Education requirements for Grand Challenge and STEM Knowledge (A1).

Because this is a Grand Challenge course, it will require you to explore a wide range of subjects, all of which are affected by big data. You will learn to think across disciplinary boundaries, and hopefully you will interact with people with different experiences, majors, and interests. You might end up writing about how algorithms (traditionally the purview of the math or statistics or computer science departments) affect marketing (traditionally addressed in the business department), or how such algorithms might require ethical evaluation (where ethics traditionally falls under the department of philosophy).

**Course Goals**

In this course students will learn ...

* the strengths and limitations of using data to understand the world
* different fields where big data is being gathered and used
- controversies surrounding the collection and use of data, and potential ethical implications
- how algorithms generate ideas from data
- to evaluate which data are appropriate for which questions
- to communicate the above goals in writing


**Student Learning Outcomes**
 
At the end of this course students should be able to...

- explain how data are produced and what makes data trustworthy and reliable  
- appreciate how data can be used to enhance our understanding of our world and in decision-making  
- critically evaluate the presentation and use of data by others  
- understand when data and algorithms are used appropriately and ethically
- demonstrate that they have accomplished the above learning outcomes in a paper

**Assignments and Grading Policy**

For each assignment you will earn points. The more points you have earned, the more you have learned. Your grade will be based on the total number of points you accumulate during the semester.

A 940-1000  
A- 900-939   
B+ 870-899   
B 830-869   
B- 800-829   
C+ 770-799   
C 730-769   
C- 700-729   
D+ 670-699   
D 600-669   
F <600

Ways to earn points:

- Class participation: 10 points per class (250 total; one absence permitted)
- Short papers: 100 points per paper (1 paper per week, 12 total, but you may only earn up to 500 points)
- Final paper: 250 points

*Expectations for class participation*: To earn full participation points during class students are expected to engage in discussion in small groups and/or turn in a short reponse to assigned readings and/or respond to questions asked by the professor.

*Expectations for short papers*: Papers should be approximately 300 words. Papers will be written in response to a prompt provided by the professor on the topic for the week. 12 prompts will be provided (1 per week except the last week). Each paper is worth 100 points. Students may write as many or as few papers as necessary to achieve a desired number of points up to 500. Thus, it is possible to achieve the maximum number of points even if a student struggles with writing assignments initially. A prompt will be provided each Friday and the paper will be due by 5pm the following Friday (except for the last week of class). Writing should be grammatically correct and arguments should be well structured. Students are expected to note sources of information, which may include the course texts, additional readings, or other material from a reputable source (check with the professor if you aren't sure). Examples for citations will be provided. A detailed rubric will be provided to guide students' writing and clarify grading. See below for assistance with writing.

*Expectations for final paper*: Papers should be approximately 2000 words. Expectations for the paper are as above; however, the final paper should synthesize materials covered in the course rather than addressing one topic. The final paper is due at 5pm on the last day of classes for the term.

*Learning to write*: During the first week of class we will discuss the expectations for writing in this course, including the grading rubric. For initial papers key points to address will be noted to aid in learning what is important to include in a paper. Throughout the course we will also discuss how assigned readings approach constructing well reasoned arguments. Because there are many assignments throughout the semester there is significant opportunity to improve based on critique from both the professor and students in the course. 

This course will require engagement with material, critical thinking, and the ability to write well-constructed arguments.  The Academic Enhancement Center helps URI students succeed through three services: Academic Coaching, Subject-Based Tutoring, and The Writing Center. To learn more about any of these services, please visit uri.edu/aec or call 401-874-2367 to speak with reception staff. Hours are posted at http://web.uri.edu/ceps/academic-skills-center/

**Instructor Policies**  

Any student with a documented disability should contact me as soon as possible so that we may arrange reasonable accommodations.  As part of this process, please be in touch with Disability Services for Students Office at 330 Memorial Union, 401-874-2098 (http://www.uri.edu/disability/dss/).  

Students are expected to treat faculty and fellow classmates with dignity and respect. Students are responsible for being familiar with and adhering to the published “Student Code of Conduct” which can be accessed in the University Student Handbook (http://web.uri.edu/studentconduct/student-handbook/).

Students are expected to be honest in all academic work. A student’s name on any written work, quiz or exam shall be regarded as assurance that the work is the result of the student’s own independent thought and study. Work should be stated in the student’s own words, properly attributed to its source.   Students have an obligation to know how to quote, paraphrase, summarize, cite and reference the work of others with integrity. The following are examples of academic dishonesty.

* Using material, directly or paraphrasing, from published sources (print or electronic) without appropriate citation
* Claiming disproportionate credit for work not done independently
* Unauthorized possession or access to exams
* Unauthorized communication during exams
* Unauthorized use of another’s work or preparing work for another student
* Taking an exam for another student
* Altering or attempting to alter grades
* The use of notes or electronic devices to gain an unauthorized advantage during exams
* Fabricating or falsifying facts, data or references
* Facilitating or aiding another’s academic dishonesty
* Submitting the same paper for more than one course without prior approval from the instructors.

If you need to miss class for any sanctioned reason (e.g. religious holiday, University-sanctioned event, serious illness, accident, personal tragedy, disability) please contact me in advance if possible to make alternate arrangements. If you miss class for an unsanctioned reason please discuss this with me to determine whether arrangements can be made. If the reason is too personal to discuss with me please discuss options with your academic advisor.

**Classroom Protocol**  

- Be prepared to discuss assigned readings.
- Be kind to others. Remember that people have different backgrounds and experiences.
- If you must come in late, please do not disrupt the class.  Please ensure all cell phones, pagers, and other electronic devices are set to silent.
- Students are expected to come to class. If you are unable to attend due to illness, severe weather, religious holiday, personal or family emergency, or sanctioned University event please let me know as soon as possible.
